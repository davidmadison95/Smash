            <h2>Super Smash Bros (1999, Nintendo 64)</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The Super Smash Bros series began in 1999 when Nintendo released the original game for the Nintendo 64. Developed by HAL Laboratory and directed by Masahiro Sakurai, the game was initially a low-priority project with a small development team and limited budget. The game's unique premise brought together Nintendo's most iconic characters—including Mario, Link, Pikachu, and Donkey Kong—in a fighting game that broke from traditional fighting game conventions. Instead of depleting health bars, players would increase their opponent's damage percentage, making them easier to knock off the stage. The original roster featured just 12 characters (with 4 being unlockable), 9 stages, and a modest selection of single-player and multiplayer modes. Despite its humble beginnings, the game sold over 5 million copies worldwide and established the foundation for what would become one of Nintendo's most successful franchises.</p>

            <h2>Super Smash Bros Melee (2001, GameCube)</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Following the success of the original game, Nintendo quickly began development on a sequel for their new GameCube console. Super Smash Bros Melee launched in 2001 in Japan and North America, expanding significantly upon its predecessor. The roster nearly doubled to 26 characters (14 returning and 12 newcomers), including additions like Princess Peach, Bowser, and Ice Climbers. The stage count increased to 29, with many featuring more dynamic elements and hazards. Melee introduced new gameplay mechanics such as air dodging and wavedashing (an unintended technique discovered by players), which dramatically increased the skill ceiling. The game also added Adventure Mode, expanded Classic Mode, and introduced trophy collecting as a way to celebrate Nintendo's history. Melee's refined gameplay and technical depth made it the competitive standard for years, with a dedicated tournament scene that remains active to this day. With over 7 million copies sold, Melee became the GameCube's best-selling game and cemented the series as a Nintendo flagship.</p>

            <h2>Super Smash Bros Brawl (2008, Wii)</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>After a longer development cycle, Super Smash Bros Brawl released for the Wii in 2008. Directed again by Masahiro Sakurai but now with his newly formed studio Sora Ltd., Brawl aimed to appeal to both casual and competitive players. The game featured significant roster expansions, bringing the total to 39 characters. Most notably, Brawl introduced the first third-party characters to the series with Solid Snake from Metal Gear Solid and Sonic the Hedgehog. The game introduced Final Smashes, powerful special moves that could be activated by breaking a Smash Ball item. Brawl's most ambitious addition was the Subspace Emissary, a side-scrolling adventure mode with cutscenes that brought the characters together in a narrative for the first time. The game also added online play through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, though it was often criticized for lag issues. Brawl was deliberately designed with slower, more accessible gameplay than Melee, including the controversial tripping mechanic that caused characters to randomly stumble. Despite mixed reception from competitive players, Brawl sold over 13 million copies, making it one of the best-selling Wii games.</p>

            <h2>Super Smash Bros for 3DS/Wii U (2014, Nintendo 3DS/Wii U)</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>For the fourth generation, Nintendo took the unprecedented step of developing two versions of Super Smash Bros simultaneously—one for the Nintendo 3DS handheld and another for the Wii U console. Released in 2014, these games marked the first time the series appeared on a handheld device. The two versions shared the same core roster of 58 characters (including DLC), with newcomers like Mega Man, Pac-Man, and Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy VII further expanding the third-party representation. While both games featured the same core fighting mechanics, they differed in their additional modes and stages. The 3DS version introduced Smash Run, a mode where players explored a large dungeon collecting power-ups before a final battle, while the Wii U version featured Smash Tour, a board game-style mode. The Wii U version also supported up to 8 players simultaneously on larger stages. These entries refined the gameplay to be faster than Brawl but more accessible than Melee, finding a middle ground that appealed to a broader audience. The 3DS version sold nearly 10 million units, while the Wii U version sold over 5 million, impressive considering the Wii U's limited install base.</p>

            <h2>Super Smash Bros Ultimate (2018, Nintendo Switch)</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Super Smash Bros Ultimate lived up to its name when it launched for the Nintendo Switch in 2018, bringing together every single fighter from the series' history along with numerous newcomers. The game's ambitious "Everyone is Here!" approach resulted in an incredible base roster of 74 characters, eventually expanding to 89 through DLC (including echo fighters). Ultimate's newcomers included long-requested additions like Ridley from Metroid, King K. Rool from Donkey Kong, and Banjo-Kazooie, alongside surprising third-party characters like Joker from Persona 5, Hero from Dragon Quest, and Steve from Minecraft. The game featured over 100 stages, all available in both their original and "Battlefield/Omega" forms, and an extensive soundtrack with over 900 music tracks. Ultimate also introduced World of Light, an adventure mode where players rescued fighters from the control of the antagonist Galeem. The gameplay was further refined with increased speed and combo potential compared to the previous entry, along with new mechanics like perfect shielding. Ultimate became a phenomenal success, selling over 30 million copies as of 2023, making it the best-selling fighting game of all time and cementing Super Smash Bros as one of Nintendo's most valuable franchises. With its final DLC character (Sora from Kingdom Hearts) released in 2021, Ultimate represents the culmination of over 20 years of Super Smash Bros history and Masahiro Sakurai's dedicated vision.</p>
